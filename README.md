### Untrusted Scammers ‚ö†Ô∏è
UnTrusted Scammers that I have dealt and worked with.
```
- ‚õî Kazuto(Kazuto911) Scammer asked for more money then we settled on and then selling pasted code I found in less then 5 minutes on github.
- ‚õî –ò–¶“úŒûD –Ø–¶SŒì„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ üóï üóó üóô(nukedrust) Exit Scamming with his "UD" Rust Internal
- ‚õî viviandeveloper(Atlas) VivianWare Admin, Skid & Time Waster will ghost & never pay
- ‚õî unlockcheat.com(unlockcod) Scammer & Time Waster, As a cheat reseller & owner (NOT A DEVELOPER) You should hold responsibility and not try to Scam & Manipulate your developers. Extremely unprofessional and not worth the time to get scammed and played.
- ‚õî whatman(writedata) Owner/Developer of Solaris Roblox Executor that was Malware & an Exposed Rat, Tried to lie and gaslight me into working with them fucking up their words and when I asked them about their malware and drama issues they started saying contridicting stuff. Later going on to say they will "Speak to their Lawyers" that is probably just a friend because they did not do our NDA Properly and failed to take base percautions in our NDA (Age & Contact Information) Along with SSI just saying "I had to sign a contract" when its an NDA we were doing, When they said they got it figured out and said we could do an NDA I asked how to Sign it and what to do they ghosted and never responded. More Controversy to the shitty Solaris Developers.
